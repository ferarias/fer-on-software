It's me, ferarias, a half-or-less-stack developer, I mainly develop in C# now and I love it, but I have worked also in VB.NET, VB6, PHP and Java.

I like messing around with anything below the HTML layer and for the last years I have been woring with TFS and VSTS.

I am married, I have a son and I try to be a good christian. These three items alone leave me few time to the other stuff, but I do my best!

Thanks for coming, feel free to contact me.
